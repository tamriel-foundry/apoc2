<p>Hey folks, we have another awesome <em>ESO</em> build to showcase, this monster Dragonknight setup is brought to us by @Lefty-Lucy who has taken the time to share the details of his unstoppable PvP secrets.</p>
<p>The objective for this build series is to dig deeper into the underlying mechanics for endgame viable builds in <em>ESO</em> in order to share information, help newer players get quickly up to speed, and challenge each other to remain current with evolving balance changes. If you would like to have a build showcased, please contact @Atropos with a short write up explaining why your setup would be a good fit for this series. Stay tuned for more featured endgame-viable builds optimized for current patch cycles coming soon from Tamriel Foundry!</p>
<p class="updated">This build is considered current as of <em>ESO</em> Update 6. Last Updated May, 2015.</p>

[caption id="attachment_588719" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/leftylucy-plain.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/leftylucy-plain-450x281.jpg" alt="Behind this pretty face lies an unstoppable juggernaut" width="450" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-588719" /></a> Behind this pretty face lies an unstoppable juggernaut[/caption]
<p>This Dragonknight build requires a substantial amount of player skill, but is capable of outlasting PvP opponents in 1v1 or 1vX scenarios while supporting teammates in small-scale PvP encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths of this build include:</strong></p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Damage mitigation</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Strong self-healing</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Mobility</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Sustained DPS</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Hard crowd control</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The build's notable weaknesses include:</strong></p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Difficulty of use</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Burst DPS</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Build cost</li>
</ul>

<p>The build excels due to its combination of offensive capability with defensive solidity. It features high base spell resist and physical resist combined with the self-healing potential of Coagulating Blood, Entropy, and Flame Lash. This Dragonknight build can harass your foes with high mobility using gap closers on all three action bars as well as multiple stacking DoTs and knockdown abilities on all three action bars to help secure kills. Some of the challenges facing players who want to use this setup include it's difficulty of use, the build requires strong awareness and resource management skills in order to succeed. Additionally, it will require patience and opportunism in order to capitalize on moments of weakness since it has a relative lack of heavy hitting attacks, and is primarily reliant on Werewolf transformation for burst capability. Lastly, to truly optimize this build it is suggested to use Warlock jewelery items, which are extremely rare and thus expensive to acquire.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Preferred Race</h2>
<hr />
<p>Many races can succeed with this build concept, but Imperial is the most highly recommended race for this build, possessing several key advantages that make it optimal for this setup. Alternatively, Nords have damage reduction and health recovery which can provide a defensive alternative within the Ebonheart Pact. In the Aldmeri Dominion, Bosmer have excellent Stamina regeneration which can help sustain this build in prolonged combat encounters. For Daggerfall players, Orsimer also have recovery passives which help your sustainability and resource management. That being said, if you are able to play as Imperial it is certainly the recommended option.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Attribute Points</h2>
<hr />
<p>To make the most of this build you will want to prioritize Health most importantly, followed closely by Stamina. The minimum Magicka pool should be sufficient for your spellcasting needs. The exact attribute split you ultimately use will depend on your gear, glyph, and Mundus Stone choices. For my VR14 I invested no points in Magicka, 37 points in Health, and 25 points in Stamina. Combined with my equipment, this results in the following unbuffed based stats while outside of Cyrodiil (at Champion rank 149):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Health: 23489</li>
	<li>Magicka: 12801</li>
	<li>Stamina: 17567</li>
	<li>Health Regen: 812</li>
	<li>Magicka Regen: 536</li>
	<li>Stamina Regen: 591</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Bonus pro-tip: Dragon Blood’s heal amount is based on your HP, not MP! Bigger health pool = bigger heals!</blockquote>

[caption id="attachment_588796" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/leftylucy-beast.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/leftylucy-beast-450x281.jpg" alt="For those times when you need to go &quot;Beast Mode&quot;" width="450" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-588796" /></a> For those times when you need to go "Beast Mode"[/caption]

<p>Your Health pool is most important, thus it has the most points invested in it. HP regeneration is left at base since the build's damage mitigation is very high. Your Magicka pool will be used primarily for support based attacks to increase survivability. Coagulating Blood is used most frequently, followed by Volatile Armor, then Obsidian Shard, and finally Flame Lash. If played correctly, this build should not have MP sustain issues in 1v1s or even 1v2s.</p>
<p>The importance of Stamina is a very close second to Health in terms of importance. When Stamina is depleted, HP will soon follow. Stamina cost reduction enchantments are mathematically more beneficial. See Weapons and Armor section for various enchantment setups depending on the combat situation. Heavy attacks must be performed periodically, since stamina regeneration is inherently low - DO NOT wait until stamina is depleted before heavy attacking! Green Dragon Blood's stamina regeneration buff does not stack with the stamina regeneration buff from potions; use Coagulating Blood for better survivability!</p>


&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Weapons and Armor</h2>
<hr />
<p>In pursuit of the best available defenses, I use mostly heavy armor to increase my base Spell Resist and Armor. The only reason I’m not using 7/7 Heavy Armor is because Warlock provides my only means of MP regeneration which is necessary for Dragon Blood casts. Since I knew I wanted Warlock, I made sure to get the two armor pieces that had the lowest impact on my overall survivability (gloves and belt). This build uses Two-Handed sword as its primary source of damage output combined with Sword and Shield for defense, control, and survivability. As a bonus offensive tactic, this build makes effective use of Werewolf transformation for unstoppable DPS when defenses can be reasonably sacrificed.</p>

			<td>This ability is used primarily because it is a gap closer. Mobility is extremely important for Dragonknights, since we are inherently lacking in this area. Critical Charge also boasts very high DPS - this skill is a no brainer. I think either morph for this ability is a good choice; Critical Rush should be chosen if your playstyle involves closing long distance gaps frequently, and Stampede should be chosen if your playstyle involves closing short distance gaps frequently.</td>

			<td>Obsidian Shard</td>
			<td>This ability is used primarily because it is a hard CC (knockdown). The range increase from this morph is very useful when you are immobilized and unable to use a gap closer. Enemies will frequently lower their defenses when they notice you are not breaking free of roots; this is the perfect time to hit them with Obsidian Shard. The other morph for this ability offers a long duration armor buff, but I prefer the increased range. My Armor is high enough!</td>

This skill does a lot of things; Heal over Time (HoT), Damage over Time (DoT),  base Health increase, and increased damage dealt with the next ability (mage guild passive: Might of the Guild). Even though each thing Structured Entropy does is not very high in magnitude, all of these little bonuses make a nice difference. Also, placing Entropy on multiple targets at the same time will give you multiple HoT ticks!</td>

			<td>This is the build's key to surviving. The end of my build video speaks extensively about this ability and HOW to use it (pro-tips involved!). I have changed from Green Dragon Blood to Coagulating Blood because the stamina regen buff from Green Dragon Blood does not stack with the stamina fegen buff from potions. Thus, I was missing out on extra healing which Coagulating Blood offers. I am very happy with this change!</td>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Typical Combat Strategy</h2>
<hr />
<p>As mentioned earlier, this build is difficult and best used by skilled players. My build video will explain how to use this build in combat, and my combat mechanics guide video will give you tips and tricks needed to dominate your opponents in PvP. I like to "go deep" in <em>ESO</em> PvP. This means I use my gap closers to charge into my enemy/enemies fearlessly, and I apply constant pressure by cycling through my DoT attacks. I always keep my DoTs applied to my target, and I always CC my target any time their defense and CC immunity is down. Resource management is my primary focus. I usually try to start using heavy attacks to regenerate my stamina when my stamina is around 75%. Continuous heavy attacks combined with restraint from spamming abilities results in my resource pools always outlasting my opponents'. Even against the builds who have crazy high regeneration, my resource management comes out on top. This is something that will come with practice!</p>

[caption id="attachment_588817" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lefty-survive.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lefty-survive-450x254.jpg" alt="Played correctly, this build can stay alive against overwhelming odds." width="450" height="254" class="size-medium wp-image-588817" /></a> Played correctly, this build can stay alive against overwhelming odds.[/caption]

<p>Because my build has high base damage resist, I don't need to block all the time. This frees me up to use heavy attacks and apply my DoTs continuously. I hate running, and I hate hiding. It's rare for me to stealth, and it's inconceivable for me to run from a fight. This is part of that "go deep" (PvP Tank) mentality; I stay in the fight until the last drop and don't show my opponent any signs of weakness. Never running from fights will force you to become a better PvP'er, because fights are always more difficult when you are low HP. I actually prefer to fight at low HP for the duration of my fights. This is a mind game I like to play with my opponents that makes them think I'm about to lose the fight, when in reality I am just baiting them and forcing them to forget about their defenses. Then I show them who their daddy is.</p>

<p>I also like to restrain from breaking CC whenever possible. This is another mind game that makes my opponent think that I am out of stamina and can not break free. This forces them to spam their abilities in an attempt to capitalize on my perceived state of vulnerability. In reality, Whitestrakes will keep me alive through their burst, and one Coagulating Blood cast will get me back up to a nice HP pool after the CC ends. At this point, the enemy's  Stamina and Magicka pools will be significantly lower. Rinse and repeat until they are out of resources. Then it will be time to find some new enemies.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Champion Progression</h2>
<hr />
<p>When investing in the Champion System, keep in mind that the rewards offered by each node have substantial diminishing returns. This means that the more points you have in a Champion passive, the less each point will increase the effectiveness of that passive. You'll be able to get some of the most important nodes by the time you reach Champion Level 90. Here are my recommendations for that level:</p>
