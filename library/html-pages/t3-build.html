<p>I'm excited to present another build in our Featured Builds series on Tamriel Foundry. This build is brought to you by the ever-awesome @Deltia who has graciously volunteered to showcase one of his battle-hardened character builds here on Tamriel Foundry. For more of Deltia's great <em>ESO</em> coverage, be sure to religiously check his website, <a href="http://deltiasgaming.com" target="_blank">deltiasgaming.com</a>.</p> 
<p>The objective for this series is to dig deeper into the underlying mechanics for endgame viable builds in <em>ESO</em> in order to share information, help newer players get quickly up to speed, and challenge each other to remain current with evolving balance changes. If you would like to have a build showcased, please contact @Atropos with a short write up explaining why your setup would be a good fit for this series. Stay tuned for more featured endgame-viable builds optimized for current patch cycles coming soon from Tamriel Foundry!</p>
<p class="updated">This build is considered current as of <em>ESO</em> Update 5. Last Updated December, 2014. It will be updated again for the Champion System prior to Update 6.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Build Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>This is the <strong>T3 Dragonknight Tank Build</strong>, a self-sustaining oasis of tanking awesomeness. I wanted to create a tank that could not only hold enemies attention, control the environment, but one that is self reliant as well.  You’re not going to replace the healer anytime soon, though when one goes down you can stay alive for a very long time giving yourself an advantage over other tanking builds. Your role is to survive and keep pressure away from your team and T3 excels at that.</p>
<p>Strengths of the T3 Tank build include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>The build is tough as nails, with excellent mitigation through Armor, Spell Resistance, and Damage Reduction.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>The T3 is highly self-sufficient, with an abundance of self healing potential.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Excellent resource management through a combination of passives, ultimates, and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The build's notable weaknesses include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Lack of versatility at range, the T3's most effective abilities require close proximity to enemies.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>The T3 is extremely sturdy, but not very powerful in terms of raw offensive potential. The objective of this build is to be as defensive as possible, and that comes at a cost of outgoing damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Weapons and Armor</h2>

"Lock and block!" is this build's mantra. Generally while playing the T3, you’ll be blocking, cycling buffs and taunts while maintaining aggro on mobs.</p>
<p><strong>Sword and Shield (Secondary Weapon)</strong> - While most builds use a different weapon type on their secondary hotbar, the T3 tank is built to last. This build keeps important utility or situational abilities on its off bar that can come in big in certain situations. You don't want to lose the crucial defenses that your sword and shield provide when switching weapons to use these abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Armor (5 Pieces), Light Armor (2 Pieces)</strong> - Heavy Armor is crucial in order to reach this build's Armor objective, using some of Dragonknights great defensive utility, this gives enough flexibility to incorporate two pieces of Light Armor for bonus Spell Resistance and Magicka efficiency.</p>

			<td>Volatile Armor</td>
			<td>I like the Volatile Armor morph for the obvious reasons and one subtle one.  It buffs our armor, returns physical damage AND does and AoE damage on cast.  While that AoE doesn’t hit very hard and look spectacular, it does generate a decent amount of ultimate throughout the fight.  So when in a group or even opening a fight, try to pop this to get a ultimate boost.</td>

			<td>Pierce Armor</td>
			<td>The standard taunt with the spell resistance debuff. This build will already be hard-capped on Physical Mitigation from Armor, so the debuff helps the DPS burn down bosses quickly. Key to this is to taunt the highest priority target on you and to not use this as a replacement DPS tool. Taunt and debuff, but don’t spam it, remember there is a taunt immunity mechanic if you overuse this ability!</td>

			<td>Choking Talons</td>
			<td>Did you know that the 15% mitigation damage this provides works with bosses? This ability is not only our main source of crowd control but it also provides a huge defensive benefit when tanking. Try to keep this up as much as possible, but be sure you are saving enough magicka for emergency self-heals.</td>

			<td><img src="http://esoimg.zamimg.com/static//esohead/image/icons/gamedata/game-backgrounds/medium/534607.png" alt="Defensive Stance"></td>
			<td>Defensive Stance</td>
			<td>Defensive Stance is the best morph of Defensive Posture to take for endgame tanking. While Absorb Magic gives you heals, who needs healing if you can reflect the damage entirely? The stun Defensive Stance provides is the trick, stunning annoying caster for three seconds is better than a self-heal. The added block mitigation and reduces block cost makes it a must have mainstay for your main action bar.</td>

			<td>Green Dragon Blood</td>
			<td>What can you say about the blood of titans? Well, it’s amazing. Keep this buff up for massive health and stamina regeneration as well as an emergency heal. I typically only use this under 30% since it scales off the amount of health lost rather than the amount that you have.</td>
		</tr>

			<td><img src="http://esoimg.zamimg.com/static//esohead/image/icons/gamedata/game-backgrounds/medium/626097.png" alt="Pack Leader"></td>

			<td>For merely having this on your bar you generate six ultimate every three seconds while taking damage. I consider this a must for serious tanks because otherwise, ultimate generation is lacking. Faster ultimate generation means more Corrosive Armor and the Battle Roar bonus it brings.</td>

			<td>Consider this marking our spot as a tank. Keep the boss in this area along with Hist Bark passive and you’ll be saving massive stamina and you’re healer precious magicka. Every cast of this ability restores 4% stamina, so if you can’t block but have Magicka to burn, dump a Cinder Storm to survive.</td>

I use this as a DPS and stamina dump tool.  With this skill and the new Gargoyle two-piece set, you’ll be an ultimate machine, 15% Weapon Damage reduction to the target is a strong debuff as well.</td>

			<td>Corrosive Armor</td>
			<td>No Dragonknight Standard and for good reason.  “If you’re going to tank, tank.” Some piece of advice that I’ve handed out and need to listen too, making the swap for Corrosive Armor an insane survival tool.  Not only does this make your DK god mode for 10 seconds, but it reduces weapon damage.  Ironically, the hardest boss in the game uses poison or weapon damage.  Meaning, this ability is just as powerful as Templar’s Nova and it’ll be hard for you to die.</td>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Typical Combat Rotation</h2>
<hr />
<p>When tanking, there is seldom a structured progression that will always work. Its much more important to focus on priories rather than a repetitive series of skills. This is what I focus on.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Neutralize the most deadly enemy</strong> - ESO doesn’t allow for a one-button mashing tank that pulls all the mobs. It's very important to identify and grab ahold of the most deadly one. Some good rules of thumb for identifying dangerous enemies are to look for physically large enemies and humanoids with two-handed weapons.</li>
	<li><strong>Interrupting is key</strong> - I’ve noticed that many tanks don’t bother interrupting spell casts. As the tank who is preventing damage not only to himself but also to his group, it is our responsibility is to stop that deadly cast that can make our break our boss run.</li>
	<li><strong>Buffs</strong> – Another responsibility is to keep our buffs and debuffs up for mitigation and added DPS. Bar one has most of our buffs but wait for a time when your healer is ready so you can swap bars and use bar two’s buffs quickly. Adding a Cinder Storm or Igneous Weapons here and there can have a major impact on the overall groups performance over time.</li>
	<li><strong>Damage</strong> – "But Deltia, I'm a tank, I don't need to do damage". Everyone needs to do some type of damage. I’ve changed my build for single target damage via Crippling Slash. Just don't forget about priorities one, two, and three.</li>

</ol>
<p>For those that love scripted actions, here’s what I normally do:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bar one - Volatile Armor, Defensive Posture, and Green Dragon Blood in preparation to pull.</li>
	<li>Bar Two - Igneous Weapons and Cinder Storm right before pulling.</li>
	<li>Bar Two - Extended Chains pull a target that would otherwise stay at range.</li>
	<li>Bar One - Pierce Armor on anything you plan to hold aggro on.</li>
	<li>From here, focus on the four priorities outlined above.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Recommended Equipment</h2>
<hr />
<p>The idea here is to be tough and not totally dependent on the healer. For that we need a lot of health and resource generation.  Some of these sets, gear, glyphs, etc take a long time to acquire so be patient. Some of the best set bonuses to work towards include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Eternal Yokudan (Tier 2 Trials Armor)</strong> - This is an improved version of the Tier 1 trial set which gives you temporary death immunity every 20 minutes as well as a huge spike in Ultimate for a quick recovery if things go badly.</li>
	<li><strong>Hist Bark (Player Crafted Armor/Weapons)</strong> - This set provides great bonuses and the five piece dodge chance really helps out our stamina. Enemies will have a high miss chance with this and Cinder Storm. These are also the best options for weapons themselves since it preserves set bonuses accross weapon swap.</li>
	<li><strong>Footman's Fortune (Dropped Dagger/Armor/Amulet)</strong> - This is one of the most important tanking sets in the game currently, the damage reduction from blocking is one of the only ways to increase your effective mitigation once you are already at the Armor cap.</li>
	<li><strong>Blood Spawn (Undaunted Helm/Shoulders)</strong> - This is a brand new set in patch 1.5 that drops in Spindleclutch.  It’s an absolute game changer considering the ultimate generation. This with Werewolf makes your tank a machine able to use rapid fire Corrosive Armors.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll really need at least five pieces of heavy armor if you intend to do top-tier PvE content. Being as close as possible to 3,300 armor is important to avoid being killed by the very hardest bosses. The current recommended setup for the T3 Tank is the following:</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Attributes and Boons</h2>
<hr />
<p>In terms of gear selection and attribute choices, the priority for outfitting a T3 Tank is the following (please note, attribute values include food buffs:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Armor</strong> - Target acquiring 3,300 Armor in order to hard-cap your Physical Mitigation. It is OK to rely on buffs which you can maintain to reach this level, but try not to rely on procs or other chance bonuses.</li>
	<li><strong>Health</strong> - Next, prioritize achieving the highest Health that is possible. Since this build doesn't use Structured Entropy, it will be tough to break 3,500 Health unless you are playing a race with an inherient passive that increases Health.</li>
	<li><strong>Stamina Recovery</strong> - Try to keep your Stamina Regeneration close to soft cap so you have the replenishment you need to keep blocking.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Food</strong> - Use Consummate Food (tri-food) since it grants the largest cumulative attribute bonus. This build uses all three resource pools, so plan on using epic food in order to get the most well rounded overall stat-line.</p>

<p><strong>Mundus Stone</strong> - You will likely want to choose your Mundus Stone based on your overall stat lines and the above priorities. If you are a bit short of 3,300 Armor, consider using The Lady. Otherwise, The Lord for an increased Health pool is a great choice.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Leveling Advice</h2>
<hr />
[caption id="attachment_561813" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/t3-tank-profile.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/t3-tank-profile-450x253.jpg" alt="The T3 Tank makes an invaluable addition to any group." width="450" height="253" class="size-medium wp-image-561813" /></a> The T3 Tank makes an invaluable addition to any group.[/caption]<p>Leveling as a "T3 Tank" can be difficult, since it's so defensive a character. You may want to consider leveling your character using a more offense-oriented approach and swith towards total defense once you reach the Veteran Ranks. At low levels, you can use a Restoration Staff to keep yourself alive while you do damage using your class abilities. Pretty much everything changes once you get Green Dragon Blood, since you can switch to using weapons and rely on GDB for healing.</p>

<p><strong>Race Choice</strong> - If you are building specifically for the T3 Tank playstyle, the best options for race are <span style="color:#FC9;">Imperial</span> (Health, Stamina, Red Diamond), <span class="daggerfall">Orsimer</span> (Health, Stamina, Health Recovery), <span class="ebonheart">Nord</span> (Health, Damage Reduction), or <span class="aldmeri">Bosmer</span> (Stamina Recovery, Stamina). If you have access to all races through the Explorer's Pack, your best choice is either Nord (maximum possible mitigation) or Imperial (larger attribute pools).</p>
