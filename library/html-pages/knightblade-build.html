<p>I'm excited to share another character concept in our Featured Builds series on Tamriel Foundry. This build is brought to us by @Xaraan who has taken the time to carefully describe the intricacies of the Nightblade tank build which can be one of the most capable single characters in the entirety of <em>ESO</em>.</p>
<p>The objective for this series is to dig deeper into the underlying mechanics for endgame viable builds in <em>ESO</em> in order to share information, help newer players get quickly up to speed, and challenge each other to remain current with evolving balance changes. If you would like to have a build showcased, please contact @Atropos with a short write up explaining why your setup would be a good fit for this series. Stay tuned for more featured endgame-viable builds optimized for current patch cycles coming soon from Tamriel Foundry!</p>
<p class="updated">This build is considered current as of <em>ESO</em> Update 6. Last Updated March, 2015.</p>

<p>The Nightblade Tank build for group content didn’t see very many huge changes with the 1.6 patch, but did get several slightly more useful powers.  We’ll go over this build from scratch, built for the Tamriel Unlimited version of <em>ESO</em> that is on the way.</p>

<p>Strengths of this build include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Very tough in most circumstances</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Good group synergy</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Good resource management</li>
</ul>

<p>The build's notable weaknesses include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Low single target DPS contribution</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>No stand-alone strong self heal</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Preferred Race</h2>
<hr />
<p>Though I think any race can pull this off, Imperial possesses several key advantages that make it clearly optimized for this setup. Altmer and Breton help with Magicka sustainability, which sees good use in this build. Orc or Redguard assist with Stamina, a prime resource for any tank. Argonian healing and bonuses are great for health, as is Nords' damage mitigation. A variety of races can bring something to the build, but Imperial offers a good combination with the class and role giving a 12% increase to maximum health, 10% increase to maximum stamina and the ‘Red Diamond’ passive giving a 10% chance to restore health with a melee attack.</p>
<p>This combines with the Nightblade skills in two ways: The Siphoning Flood passive gives an 8% increase to magicka when a siphoning ability is slotting.   This gives you increases to all three attributes — which is nice with soft caps removed in 1.6.  It also makes use of the combined active abilities of Imperial and Nightblade: Siphoning Attacks will give you a chance to regenerate all three attributes during melee attacks when combined with the Red Diamond passive.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Attribute Points</h2>
<hr />
<p>At VR14, aim for over 30K health after using Consummate tri-stat food while keeping the rest split evenly into Magicka and Stamina since both will be used quite a bit and both will regen well from siphoning strikes, maybe leaning toward Stamina if they aren't quite even.  During leveling, keep all points into Health until you get to the last dozen or so levels and then begin to divide them up to achieve your final numbers. Use item enchantments split between Magicka and Stamina, to keep both resource pools relatively even in size. This build will make use of both resources equally during fights.</p>
<p>Recovery bers aren’t a priority for this build since I rely on Siphoning Strikes to keep my resources up.  But I do get a bonus to stamina regeneration from Nightblade passives, which is great for a tank, and a couple regen bonuses from the armor sets I use.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Weapons and Armor</h2>
<hr />
[caption id="attachment_570540" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/knightblade10.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/knightblade10-450x281.jpg" alt="temporary" width="450" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-570540" /></a>The Knightblade uses primarily Sword and Shield.[/caption]
<p>All of my choices for both of these bars are for tanking. Not to say that in some situations you can’t change it up and do a little more damage, but for the most part I go into tanking knowing that my job is to tank. So you’ll see very little damage dealing on my bars outside of ultimates.</p>
<p>I often vary my second bar between Two-Handed, Restoration Staff or even Bow depending on the situation.  Restoration staff can be considered the default here as most of the powers on the second bar are class abilities and one heal from the weapon abilities.  Restoration offers a wider variety of healing options for the group and a ranged attack when needed, with the benefit of rebuilding your magicka as you attack.  But Two-Handed is a solid alternative and can be used as your normal weapon for leveling. It has it’s own self heal you can use in place of the Restoration Staff heal and offers a few other options like Brawler for a another self-shield or Executioner for an execute. You will be limited in attacking from range and lose the ability to build up your Magicka with this choice however, plus any abilities you use from this weapon line will drain your Stamina - which you should avoid as a tank.</p>
<p>I have been running 5 piece Heavy, 1 Light and 1 Medium to take advantage of the Undaunted passive: Undaunted Mettle and receive a 6% bonus to max health, stamina and magicka on top of the boosts already mentioned.  It also offers a small boosts to cost reduction, regen, and dodge roll while only giving up a small boost to Armor, Spell Resist, and 2% healing received.  Of course the two pieces you should try to use for light and medium are your shoulder and belt if possible as they have the smallest amount of armor to be effected for not being heavy.</p>

			<td>I have always preferred this one over the Undaunted Taunt in 90% of the situations I find myself in (and with this build). Reducing the Armor and Spell resistance of the boss is a good debuff for the team and helps ensure the target dies faster, which is a little of that offense making a good defense.   The times I tend to run Inner Rage (taking the magicka version of this so that I have a taunt that uses each type of resource) is when I know I’ll be doing nothing but blocking (like hard mode Banished Cells for example) and don’t want to waste stamina.  Or in the Arena when you are taunting more often at range, plus I like to run both here so that I’ll always have a resource ready to taunt something with so my team isn’t taking hits more than they need to.</td>

			<td>Defensive Posture</td>
			<td>Though the Absorb Magicka morph can be a good alternative, this version will simply find more overall usefulness.  It reflects a spell, damaging the attacker and stunning them (if they aren't a boss), which will prevent future damage not just for you, but for the group. It can also be one of the stronger forms of dealing damage for a tank build. Beware over-spamming the ability however as you don't want to drain your stamina.  Even without activating the ability it's very useful for a tank, giving an 8% block cost reduction and mitigation boost.</td>

			<td>Sap Essence</td>
			<td>The bread and butter of this build on trash pulls. I usually swap it out for Swallow Soul for boss/single target fights for the HoT and Minor Vitality buff, but for everything else there is sap.  It doesn’t do a ton of damage or even healing with this build, but it does enough while unofficially pulling aggro on a lot of targets quickly, generating ultimate faster and giving everyone in your area a heal.  It also triggers your Siphoning Strikes which keeps your stamina up while blocking multiple targets in the middle of a pile of mobs.  The problem here that some overlook is that it loses usefulness the less targets that are around you, to the point that it doesn’t help much at all versus only one or two mobs. This is also the power that I blow my magicka on the quickest and why I prefer the stamina taunt. It’s also costly for this build, so it’s not something you want to spam endlessly. </td>

			<td><img src="http:////esoimg.zamimg.com/static//esohead/image/icons/gamedata/game-backgrounds/medium/626083.png" alt="Spiked Bone Shield"></td>
			<td>Spiked Bone Shield</td>
			<td>This is a great taking ability which gives you a physical shield equal to 30% of your Health. Allies can activate a synergy to get their own shields as well. The only draw back is that the duration is only 6 seconds and that is protects against physical damage only, but the cost is half of what Circle of Protection offers so it’s slightly easier to spam without wasting stamina, but it will still be important to pick your uses with this so you don’t drain your main tanking resource.</td>

			<td>Siphoning Attacks</td>
			<td>This is the main reason to use a Nightblade tank.  If you weave in light attacks between blocking you’ll constantly regenerate your stamina and magicka (plus, with the Imperial passive, also your health).   I prefer this morph as well because it gives you a chance to trigger the effect on any attack, which means when you are doing something like sapping in a trash pull you’ll be recovering stamina for blocking and extra magicka for more sapping.  The negative effect to damage that using this power gives you is also unimportant for a tank, so it’s a win-win and will keep you from begging for shards from a templar too often.</td>

			<td><img src="http://esoimg.zamimg.com/static//esohead/image/icons/gamedata/game-backgrounds/medium/584545.png" alt="Veil of Blades"></td>
			<td>Veil of Blades</td>
			<td>Yes, we did lose 30% of our damage mitigation in 1.6, now only receiving the 30% everyone in the AoE receives, but you’ll get the shadow passive bonus to armor and spell resist when casting this, so it makes up some of the difference.  You can take the other morph: Bolstering Darkness if you want to get up to 60% mitigation again, but for a tank, you should be alright mitigation wise already and most players will get more use out of doing almost 10K damage with veil of blades.  Keeping this on your bar also gives you a shadow passive bonus: Dark Vigor which increases your health by 3% for each ability slotted.  I tried to double up on this by swapping out Refreshing Path for Bone Shield, but didn’t like having to weapon swap to activate the this timing wise.  At least keeping this ultimate on the bar gives you one 3% increase.</td>

			<td>This first slot is for any healing power, Vigor if you have access to it can be a good choice, as is Rally from two-handed line.  But restoration staff gives you the most options and won’t drain your stamina, making it the safest choice.  Healing Ward makes an excellent emergency use heal, if you are the only one left or solo you’ll get the ward, but if you see someone in the group in trouble and the healer is out of commission you can quickly pop this power to help out the team.  Combat Prayer and Mutagen make good alternatives as well.  Mutagen is a good choice as a back-up heal as it wills tack with Rapid Regeneration, which most healers will take, so it can offer the team two separate healing ticks.  But for a low-health need, Healing Ward will give you the most impact as it scales up for low health.</td>

			<td>A decent AoE heal over time effect and does a little damage, rotating this into a rotation also triggers the shadow passive Shadow Barrier.  This used to only trigger out of stealth prior to 1.6, now will trigger every time you use a shadow ability, giving you Major Ward/Resolve, which is 5120 Armor and Spell Resist for 9 seconds.  Once your rotation is down walking through all the powers on both of these bars, you’ll be able to keep that buff up almost the entire battle.  This is also another power that, like sap, can call a lot of enemies to you first as you charge into a mob pack and keep most of them clear from the rest of the group until you have time to pick and choose your taunts (assuming your group is letting you pull and isn’t rushing ahead).</td>

It will effect the target with Minor Maim debuff, reducing the damage they do by 15% for 4 seconds after each shade attack.  This is a different category buff than receiving a buff to yourself, so it stacks nicely with the damage mitigation you get from Footman’s set, bonuses to your own armor from Mirage or from the shadow barrier passive, plus it’s another shadow power that triggers that passive.</td>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Typical Combat Strategy</h2>
<hr />
[caption id="attachment_572656" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/knightblade09.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/knightblade09-450x281.jpg" alt="The Knightblade build can easily control large groups of enemies." width="450" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-572656" /></a> The Knightblade build can easily control large groups of enemies.[/caption]<p>This build plays a bit differently for trash pulls and boss pulls. For trash pulls, normally I start by casting Mirage and then throwing down Refreshing Path, a great ability for grabbing initial aggro and triggering my shadow passive granting extra Armor and Spell Resist. Next I swap bars, maintaining taunt on the major targets. From here, Sap Essence will keep you going while your group finishes clearing the pack.</p>

<p>For boss fights which include groups of adds, a pull starts much the same way. Make sure to keep taunt and Shades applied on the boss itself. I don’t often use my ultimate on trash, but a group fight with boss will get a Veil right away.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that Nightblades do not have any real CC abilities like Dragonknight’s Dark Talons, so having your team know what to expect is important. If group members are used to having a DK chain pull everything in and keep it in place with Talons, the playstyle with a Nightblade tank may seem foreign. However, if everyone knows the plan there is usually zero problem with not having access to those powers. My static group lets me control the pull so mobs don’t split up as much. Make sure your team understands the tanking style that will be most successful for your build. Sometimes you will need to switch to your ranged taunt, but for most fights it’s usually unnecessary and often hard to target the exact mob you need to taunt from range. Save Inner Rage for situations like Dragonstar Arena where you’ll pull at a distance from all directions or where you want to really conserve Stamina.</p>

<p>In a single target boss fight I will swap Sap Essence for Swallow Soul. On pull, I’ll cast Mirage, Shades, and Refreshing Path before picking up the boss with Taunt. At this point its most important to balance between re-applying Shades, Path, and Mirage while keeping Funnel Health going. You'll have time to spare between maintaining these, so consider using abilities like Circle of Protection or Bone Shield to help your group through high damage phases. Against a spellcaster boss I’ll also work Defensive Posture into the rotation. The important thing here is to get your timing down against the bosses attacks and weave in Light Attacks occasionally to siphon resources and generate Ultimate.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Recommended Equipment</h2>
<hr />
<p>I like to run 5 pieces of Heavy Armor, with 1 piece each of Light and Medium to maximize the effectiveness of the Undaunted Mettle passive. If you would rather have the highest possible damage mitigation this build will also work effectively with all Heavy Armor pieces. If you do use any non-Heavy pieces you should try to use belt, gloves, or shoulders to minimize the lost Armor potential. My recommended sets are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>5 Footman (using 3 pieces jewelry) — Adds health, Armor and Spell Resist.  Five piece bonus increases block mitigation by 12%.</li>
	<li>2 Bloodspawn (Undaunted Mask/Shoulder set) — Adds stamina regen and gives a 6% chance when hit to gain 5850 Armor and Spell Resist and restore 15 ultimate (6 sec cool down)</li>
	<li>5 Whitestrake’s — Adds health, spell resist and health recovery.  Five piece bonus gives you a 10080 point damage shield when your health drops below 30% (15 sec cool down)</li>
</ul>

<p>The damage mitigation provided by the Footman set is essentially required, but you can substitute other sets in place of Whitestrake’s if you like. In 1.6 it is now possible to get a Footman shield, so this allows more flexibility in possible loadouts. Nightblade will not benefit as much as other classes from the Hist Bark set because Mirage now applies Dodge chance and will not stack. Some other useful sets to consider include Eternal Yokeda (Sanctum Ophidia) or Undaunted Bastion.</p>

<p>A couple of other Undaunted sets can also be useful; specifically Malubeth the Scourger or the Engine Guardian. I simply prefer the stamina regen, extra armor, spell resist, and ultimate bonus with the Bloodspawn set when tanking for a group, but I will often switch to Engine Guardian when soloing.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Champion Progression</h2>
<hr />

Mostly I chose a few passives to focus on and spread points out to some others as once you start getting five or six points into a stat the return is so low that it can make getting a 1% bump elsewhere more valuable — if that elsewhere is useful.  One you get a larger pool of champion points however, it may be beneficial to redistribute points as you can open up passives at certain “tiers” in the system for larger bonuses.  My main thought process early on is to look to take advantage of the bashing/blocking abilities as there are a few that can end up being beneficial together and of course spread out points for the most mitigation you can get.</p>

<strong>The Thief</strong>
<p>Put most of your points into The Tower constellation. I dumped several points into Bashing immediately (reducing stamina cost for bash attacks) and divided up a few to the other three to open up Ensnare.  Ensnare grants a 33% chance to reduce enemy movement speed with a bash attack. In The Lover, the most useful node is Tenacity. Although I think my setup is good for resource management already, getting a boost to what a heavy attack can restore is a decent bonus. Within The Shadow, Nimble and Elusive are both extremely useful investments for tanking, reducing damage or duration of effects.</p>

<strong>The Mage</strong>
<p>The Mage constellation was the least important to me in how I spent my points and they mostly went into buffing my weapon damage because I had the points to spend and to make my attacks a bit more useful when solo. Blessed under Apprentice can be a good bonus since this build will make use of Sap Essence quite a bit, but as healing isn’t your overall focus it won’t hurt to divide them elsewhere. The first 10 points in both the Atronach and Ritual constellations are useful to open up the first passives which give bonuses for blocking or interrupting - activities you will do out of habit while tanking. You should also look into redistribution when you have thirty points to open up the Riposte passive which will give you a chance to return damage to attackers when blocking.</p>

<strong>The Warrior</strong>
<p>This is our bread and butter tree, with 10 points going into the Steed right away to open up the Invigorating Bash passive, giving you a 20% chance to restore health when bashing.  My points went into Spell shield and Blocking mostly, but if you PvP a lot some points in Resistant will help as well. The Lady also has useful nodes with Hardy, Thick Skinned and Elemental Defender. Combat Medic in The Lord is also useful for those times when you need to rescue your party from death, the damage reduction will probably be needed. Again, you’ll probably want to redistribute points when you get enough to achieve the different “tiers,” as the Steed offers good cornerstone bonuses at 75 points and 120 points.</p>
