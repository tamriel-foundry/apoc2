<p>We're beginning a recurring "featured builds" series on Tamriel Foundry similar to the <a href="http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/category/battlemasters-corner" target="_blank">Battlemaster's Corner</a> series featured on the official <em>ESO</em> site. The objective for our series is to dig deeper into the underlying mechanics for endgame viable builds in <em>ESO</em> in order to share information, help newer players get quickly up to speed, and challenge each other to remain current with evolving balance changes. If you would like to have a build showcased, please contact @Atropos with a short write up explaining why your setup would be a good fit for this series.</p>
<p class="updated">This build is considered current as of <em>ESO</em> Update 5. Last Updated December, 2014.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Build Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>This is the <strong>Reaver Sorcerer</strong>, a Stamina-based Sorcerer DPS build that is a highly mobile skirmisher capable of dealing high sustained damage in both melee and ranged combat.</p>
<p>Strengths of the Reaver build include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Excellent Health sustain in combat by taking advantage of a variety of combat healing mechanics.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Combat flexibility, easily moving in and out of melee range as well as easily alternating between single target and AoE situations.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>High damgage, reporting up to 1,200 single target or up to 4,000 AoE damage-per-second.
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Rapid Ultimate generation.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-plus-square fa-li"></i>Strong ganking potential in PvP acting as a solo stealther.</li>
</ul>
<p>The build's notable weaknesses include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Co-dependance on Stamina for both DPS output and defensive actions.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Vulnerable when running low on resources without a reliable means of replenishing Stamina and Magicka pools.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>Success with this build can be heavily gear dependent.</li>
	<li><i class="fa fa-minus-square fa-li"></i>The Reaver playstyle is fairly "twitchy", requiring managing overlapping buff/debuff timers and utilizing frequent weapon swaps.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Weapons and Armor</h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>Dual Wield (Primary Weapon)</strong> - The Reaver uses Dual Wield as it’s primary weapon type which contributes strong sustained damage from close range, a hybrid AoE/Execute ability, a powerful DoT which dovetails nicely with the Bow line, and a fantastic set of passives for Stamina based DPS. Dual Wield is preferred to Two-Handed largely for it's passive abilities and Critical Chance potential. While Executioner is a superior execute to Steel Tornado, Dual Wield complements Bow better when both lines are used in combination.</p>
<p><strong>Bow (Secondary Weapon)</strong> - The Update 5 changes have transformed Bow into a fantastic supporting weapon which contributes flexibility in positioning, mobility, and excellent sustained damage with two awesome DoT abilities as well as a bread-and-butter single-target attack.</p>
<p><strong>Medium Armor (7 Pieces)</strong> - Medium Armor is the obvious choice for this build since the Reaver as it is extremely Stamina and Melee Critical reliant.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Typical Combat Rotation</h2>
<hr />
<p>Always open each fight with a pre-buff of Critical Surge and a Focused Aim sneak attack. For single-target encounters, this build relies on maintaining multiple damage-over-time abilities, Critical Surge, while looking for opportunities to contribute high burst. This build uses a bread and butter 10-second ranged rotation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Arrow Barrage (11s) - Use a Critical potions when you are starting a fresh rotation</li>
	<li>Poison Injection (10s)</li>
	<li>Focused Aim</li>
	<li>Focused Aim</li>
	<li>Focused Aim</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the 1st rotation and alternating every other set thereafter refresh Critical Surge (lasts 20 seconds). Before the 1st rotation and before every 3rd set refresh Razor Caltrops (lasts 30 seconds). If you find yourself in melee range in-between rotations, it is highly advisable to quickly weapon swap and apply Rending Slashes to your target. This can complicate your timing slightly, but provides excellent DPS contribution, ultimate generation, and additional proc chances. For AoE encounters, the Reaver takes advantage of Dual Wield heavily. The above rules regarding Critical Surge and Razor Caltrops still apply in the AoE context. A standard AoE rotation would look like the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Arrow Barrage (11s) - Weapon swap while barrage is in the air</li>
	<li>Steel Tornado - Stand in the middle of your freshly dropped Barrage</li>
	<li>Steel Tornado</li>
	<li>Steel Tornado</li>
	<li>Steel Tornado</li>
</ul>
<p>Rinse and repeat this AoE rotation, applying Flawless Dawnbreakers as they become available and refreshing Critical Surge and Caltrops as needed. If enemies are near death, consider activating Boundless Storm for chances at Disintigration procs.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Recommended Equipment</h2>
<hr />
Equipping the Reaver is critically important for the success of the build. As mentioned previously, one of the big weaknesses of this setup is a high level of gear dependency in order to make this build viable for endgame DPS. There are several item sets that are very attractive for this build, some of the best options include:

<ul>
	<li><strong>The Vicious Serpent (Tier 2 Trials Armor)</strong> - The vastly improved version of the Quick Serpent set, this is an entire replacement for the previous set and should absolutely be worn if possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Hunding's Rage (Crafted Weapons/Armor)</strong> - Hunding's Rage is the best player crafted set available to the Reaver Build. 8% Critical Chance as well as a large chunk of Weapon Power makes this a must use unless you have access to 5 pieces of Vicious Serpent.</li>
	<li><strong>Viper's Sting (Dropped Dagger/Armor/Amulet)</strong> - This set drops in Sanctum Ophidia at VR14 and is Bound on Equip, so it can frequently be purchased from large guild stores. It offers 8% crit and a 5-piece proc which adds a pretty consistent 25-30 DPS in single target fights.</li>
	<li><strong>The Quick Serpent (Tier 1 Trials Armor)</strong> - Adds Critical Chance and Stamina, two great stats. The 5 piece bonus isn't worth the investment, however, so it's better to stop at 3 or 4 pieces.</li>
	<li><strong>Nerien'eth (Undaunted Helm/Shoulders)</strong> - The Lich Crystal proc works very well with this build because of the high number of simultaneous damage sources. Caltrops, Arrow Barrage, Poison Injection, and Rending Slashes are all hitting simultaneously and allow the Lich Crystal to proc often enough to justify it's use. The Lich Crystal typically ranges anywhere between 25 and 250 DPS depending on the abundance of enemies in the area.</li>
	<li><strong>The Master's Dagger</strong> - Passive Weapon Damage as well as increased DoT damage on one of your staple abilities makes this a good weapon to use. Since Dual Wield has one extra equipment slot over Bow, using this one-piece weapon set works well with swapping between hotbars and not breaking any sets.</li>
	<li><strong>The Master's Bow</strong> - Grants an excellent bonus to damage dealt against targets affected by your Poison Injection.</li>
	<li><strong>Poisonous Serpent / Berserking Yokeda (rings and amulet)</strong> - These sets are good to use for the 2 piece Critical Chance bonus, but don't be fooled by the 3 piece on the Bow set, it only contributes around 5 DPS in prolonged fights.</li>
</ul>

Itemization can be a puzzle given all of the options that are available, the most important thing is that you use the best sets available to your character and find a way to fill in the gaps with useful bonuses. A reasonable goal to aim for with equipment is something resembling the following setup (which does not use Sanctum Ophidia gear). If you have access to Medium Armor from the Serpent Trial, you should use that set instead of the Nerien'eth and Viper pieces.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Attributes and Boons</h2>
<hr />
In terms of gear selection and attribute choices, the priority for outfitting a Reaver Sorcerer is the following:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Unique Set Bonuses</strong> - First choose your preferred 5-piece bonus, Undaunted 2-piece, Master Weapon, or other special set properties.</li>
	<li><strong>Melee Critical Chance</strong> - Next, prioritize achieving the highest Melee Critical chance that is feasible using available gear sets.</li>
	<li><strong>Health</strong> - I recommend running with around <span style="color: #ff0000;">3,000 health</span> at VR14. The Reaver is at home in the middle of damage, using self-healing to sustain. The high AoE DPS of this build will attract a lot of enemy attention, so don't skimp too much on health.</li>
	<li><strong>Stamina</strong> - Target at least <span style="color: #339933;">2,400 Stamina</span> which contributes to Weapon Damage as well as grants a large resource pool for consistent damage output.</li>
	<li><strong>Magicka</strong> - You should not need an extremely large Magicka pool on the Reaver build, as you are primarily using Magicka for maintaining buffs rather than dealing damage. I find that <span style="color: #3366ff;">1,500 Magicka</span> is sufficient at VR14.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Food</strong> - Use Consummate Food (tri-food) on the Reaver since it grants the largest cumulative attribute bonus. This build uses all three resource pools, so plan on using epic food in order to get the most well rounded overall stat-line. 

<strong>Mundus Stone</strong> - As far as Mundus Stone choice goes, I recommend the Shadow Stone. If you have a high Critical Chance (over 50%), you're overall DPS will benefit substantially from using the Shadow Stone rather than increasing your base crit percentage.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Leveling Advice</h2>
<hr />
<p>Leveling the "Reaver Build" can be tricky at first, as it's reliance on Critical Surge is substantial for survivability. I recommend substituting Two-Handed for Dual Wield early on. Cleave and Critical Charge are both excellent abilities for low level gameplay. Once you have unlocked Critical Surge, Dual Wield will be much more effective. The Storm Atronach is a valuable Ultimate to lean on for difficult fights until you have achieved Fighter's Guild rank 10.</p>
<p><strong>Race Choice</strong> - If you are building specifically for the Reaver Sorcerer playstyle, the best options for race are <span style="color:#FC9;">Imperial</span> (Health, Stamina, Red Diamond), <span class="daggerfall">Redguard</span> (Stamina, Stamina Regen, Adrenaline), <span class="ebonheart">Dunmer</span> (Stamina, Magicka, Fire Resistance), or <span class="aldmeri">Khajiit</span> (Stealth Damage, Weapon Critical).</p>
