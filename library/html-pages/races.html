<h3 class="race-title">TBA</h3>
<p>Every race receives the same number of possible racial passives, the first of which is given to every new character for free. This first ability is a 15% bonus to experience gained while leveling a specific weapon or armor skill line. This ability is in-line with the lore and background of the race and it’s cultural preferences, however should not be a big factor in determining the “best” race for you. Everyone will end up with 50 in their weapon and armor skills in the long run, so while this is a useful benefit to have while leveling, these first-tier passives offer no long-run utility. The following three passives per race each have three ranks, which increase in power as you invest skill points into them. Not all racial passives can be unlocked at first. In fact, your character in ESO has an entire “racial” skill line that progresses at approximately alongside your character levels. Only the first rank of the first passive will be available to you starting at level 5.</p>
