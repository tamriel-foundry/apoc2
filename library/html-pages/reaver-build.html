We're beginning a recurring "featured builds" series on Tamriel Foundry similar to the <a href="http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/category/battlemasters-corner" target="_blank">Battlemaster's Corner</a> series featured on the official <em>ESO</em> site. The objective for our series is to dig deeper into the underlying mechanics for endgame viable builds in <em>ESO</em> in order to share information, help newer players get quickly up to speed, and challenge each other to remain current with evolving balance changes. If you would like to have a build showcased, please contact @Atropos with a short write up explaining why your setup would be a good fit for this series.

<p class="updated">This build is considered current as of <em>ESO</em> Update 5.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Build Overview</h2>
<hr />
This is the <strong>Reaver Sorcerer</strong>, a Stamina-based Sorcerer DPS build that is a highly mobile skirmisher capable of dealing high sustained damage in both melee and ranged combat. Strengths of the Reaver build include:
<ul>
	<li>Incredible passive Health sustain in combat by taking advantage of a variety of combat healing mechanics.</li>
	<li>Excellent combat flexibility, easily moving in and out of melee range as well as easily alternating between single target and AoE situations.</li>
	<li>High sustained yield, reporting up to 1,200 single target or up to 4,000 AoE damage-per-second.
	<li>Rapid Ultimate generation.</li>
	<li>Strong ganking potential in PvP acting as a solo stealther.</li>
</ul>
The build's notable weaknesses include:
<ul>
	<li>Co-dependance on Stamina for both DPS output and defensive actions.</li>
	<li>Vulnerable when running low on resources without a reliable means of replenishing Stamina and Magicka pools.</li>
	<li>Success with this build can be heavily gear dependent.</li>
	<li>The Reaver playstyle is fairly "twitchy", requiring managing overlapping buff/debuff timers and utilizing frequent weapon swaps.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align:center">Weapons and Armor</h2>
<hr />
<strong>Dual Wield (Primary Weapon)</strong> - The Reaver uses Dual Wield as it’s primary weapon type which contributes strong sustained damage from close range, a hybrid AoE/Execute ability, a powerful DoT which dovetails nicely with the Bow line, and a fantastic set of passives for Stamina based DPS. Dual Wield is preferred to Two-Handed largely for it's passive abilities and Critical Chance potential. While Executioner is a superior execute to Steel Tornado, Dual Wield complements Bow better when both lines are used in combination.

<strong>Bow (Secondary Weapon) -</strong> The Update 5 changes have transformed Bow into a fantastic supporting weapon which contributes flexibility in positioning, mobility, and excellent sustained damage with two awesome DoT abilities as well as a bread-and-butter single-target attack.

<strong>Medium Armor (7 Pieces)</strong> - Medium Armor is the obvious choice for this build, as it is extremely Stamina and Melee Critical reliant.

			<td>The fourth slot on your hotbar is a rotating "utility" slot. For PvP and soloing I prefer Streak which combos very well with Rending Slashes and weapon swap into Bow. For PvE encounters, Evil Hunter, Lightning Flood, or Daedric Minefield are all useful situational options.</td>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Recommended Equipment</h2>
<hr />
Equipping the Reaver is critically important for the success of the build. As mentioned previously, one of the big weaknesses of this setup is a high level of gear dependency in order to make this build viable for endgame DPS. There are several item sets that are very attractive for this build, some of the best options include:

<ul>
	<li><strong>The Vicious Serpent (Tier 2 Trials Armor)</strong> - The vastly improved version of the Quick Serpent set, this is an entire replacement for the previous set and should absolutely be worn if possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Hunding's Rage (Crafted Weapons/Armor)</strong> - Hunding's Rage is the best player crafted set available to the Reaver Build. 8% Critical Chance as well as a large chunk of Weapon Power makes this a must use unless you have access to 5 pieces of Vicious Serpent.</li>
	<li><strong>Viper's Sting (Dropped Dagger/Armor/Amulet)</strong> - This set drops in Sanctum Ophidia at VR14 and is Bound on Equip, so it can frequently be purchased from large guild stores. It offers 8% crit and a 5-piece proc which adds a pretty consistent 25-30 DPS in single target fights.</li>
	<li><strong>The Quick Serpent (Tier 1 Trials Armor)</strong> - Adds Critical Chance and Stamina, two great stats. The 5 piece bonus isn't worth the investment, however, so it's better to stop at 3 or 4 pieces.</li>
	<li><strong>Nerien'eth (Undaunted Helm/Shoulders)</strong> - The Lich Crystal proc works very well with this build because of the high number of simultaneous damage sources. Caltrops, Arrow Barrage, Poison Injection, and Rending Slashes are all hitting simultaneously and allow the Lich Crystal to proc often enough to justify it's use. The Lich Crystal typically ranges anywhere between 25 and 250 DPS depending on the abundance of enemies in the area.</li>
	<li><strong>The Master's Dagger</strong> - Passive Weapon Damage as well as increased DoT damage on one of your staple abilities makes this a good weapon to use. Since Dual Wield has one extra equipment slot over Bow, using this one-piece weapon set works well with swapping between hotbars and not breaking any sets.</li>
	<li><strong>The Master's Bow</strong> - Grants an excellent bonus to damage dealt against targets affected by your Poison Injection.</li>
	<li><strong>Poisonous Serpent / Berserking Yokeda (rings and amulet)</strong> - These sets are good to use for the 2 piece Critical Chance bonus, but don't be fooled by the 3 piece on the Bow set, it only contributes around 5 DPS in prolonged fights.</li>
</ul>

Itemization can be a puzzle given all of the options that are available, the most important thing is that you use the best sets available to your character and find a way to fill in the gaps with useful bonuses.
