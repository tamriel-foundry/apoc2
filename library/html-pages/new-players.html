Hello <em>ESO</em> enthusiasts! With console release just around the corner I thought it would be worthwhile for me to take some time and share my own experiences and knowledge regarding <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, particularly when it comes to certain tips, tricks, and suggestions that I wish I had know when I started playing the game. Many of you may prefer to find your own way through the vast and wonderful world of Nirn, but those of you who want to make sure you get a fast and efficient start to your journey should look no further. An initial caveat regarding all of these suggestions. Not all of them may apply to every character, and some of you may disagree regarding certain these points which is completely fine! I hope, however, that everyone can learn some interesting ideas and strategies you may not have considered. Good luck to those of you who will be creating new characters on Tuesday and welcome to Tamriel!

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Character Creation</h2>
<hr />

&nbsp;
<strong>Choose wisely.</strong> There are only three meaningful decisions in <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> that you cannot change, redo, or reconfigure. Those are your choices for class, race, and appearance.

&nbsp;
<strong>Play the race you want to play.</strong> If there is one of Tamriel's races that strongly appeals to you because of their lore, appearance, or your past experiences in other <em>TES</em> games, then you should play as that race. If you do not have a clear favorite, carefully consider which racial passives will be the most beneficial for your character. Don't be influenced by the first passive; it is only relevant while you are leveling and yields no long-term benefit. If you are completely on the fence and need a recommendation; Imperial (requires Imperial Edition), Dunmer (Ebonheart Pact), Breton (Daggerfall Covenant), and Altmer (Aldmeri Dominion) are races with generally useful racial abilities for most builds. Our <a title="Check out the TF Racial Comparison page." href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/races/" target="_blank">Racial Comparison</a> on Tamriel Foundry can give you more insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each playable race.

&nbsp;
<strong>Play the class you want to play.</strong> Similar to the previous point, if you like the fundamental idea of one class the best you should definitely choose that class. Many players will be on the fence and finding it difficult to decide; after all, any class can fill any role, use any weapon, and specialize in any type of combat. The best advice I can give is that if you are undecided which class to play, choose the class that aligns most naturally to your preferred play-style. While any class can perform any role, certain classes will find it far more natural to do so.
<ul>
	<li>Tanking - Dragonknight or Templar</li>
	<li>Healing - Templar</li>
	<li>Archery - Nightblade</li>
	<li>Stealth - Nightblade</li>
	<li>Mage - Sorcerer</li>
	<li>Melee - Dragonknight</li>
	<li>Summoner - Sorcerer</li>
</ul>
Again, this is not to say that the above relationships are all that is possible, far from it, but as a new player you will have an easier (and probably more enjoyable) time achieving your desired character play-style if you color within the lines.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Your First Steps</h2>
<hr />

&nbsp;
<strong>Diversify your skills early.</strong> By the time you escape the Wailing Prison you will probably have three skill points. Make sure your first three skill points go into the first skill in each of your class skill trees, even if one tree does not appeal to you very much or if its starter skill doesn't seem useful for your character. It will ultimately be very important to have all your class skill lines fully leveled. The only way they will gain experience is if you are using an ability from that line on your action bar. While you are leveling, make sure to always keep at least one skill from each of your class lines on your bar at all times.

&nbsp;
<strong>Don't forget to Soul Trap!</strong> By escaping the Wailing Prison your character automatically learns the spell Soul Trap. Most players don't realize they have access to this ability since there is no obvious prompt in-game letting you know that it has been unlocked. As soon as you get out of the prison you can find soul trap under the Soul Magic skill line beneath the "World" category in the skills list. It's not the most powerful spell, but hey, it's better than an empty slot on your bar. Some builds may find it useful early on as a way to pull enemies with a damage-over-time effect. It is also, as in previous Elder Scrolls games, the way you fill empty soul gems that you will find throughout the world.

&nbsp;

There is no downside to joining the Fighter's Guild, and every character will want to progress through it at some point even if they don't consider themselves to be playing a "Fighter" archetype.

The primary means of advancement through the Fighter's Guild is with experience earned slaying Undead and Daedra enemies. The sooner you join the guild, the earlier you can start earning credit for your deeds as you slay these types of foes. Additionally, joining the Fighter's Guild will allow you to purchase the Intimiade skill which I'll talk more about later.

&nbsp;
<strong>Return to the starter island.</strong> After the Wailing Prison, low level characters are intended to start their adventure on a "starter island". In order to give players the freedom of adventuring in whichever direction they prefer, ZeniMax changed the new player experience to allow your character to emerge from the Wailing Prison in the mainland areas of Tamriel (or Auridon).

It is strongly recommended, however, that you return to this island and complete the quests you find there. It will be a much smoother start to the game, the enemies you face will be more appropriate in difficulty, and you will avoid a situation where you are running out of level-appropriate quests to do. To return to this island look for a quest-giver by the docks in town that will take you to Khenarthi's Roost (Aldmeri Dominion), Stros m'Kai (Daggerfall Covenant), or Bleakrock Isle (Ebonheart Pact).

&nbsp;
<strong>Acquire early skyshards.</strong> You will have obtained your first Skyshard during the tutorial in the wailing prison. If you can quickly locate two additional Skyshards this will grant you a skill point which you can use to obtain a 5th skill to start leveling early. The most efficient early-game action bar setup using your first four skill points is one ability from each of the three class trees, one weapon ability, and Soul Trap. The <a title="Check out the TF Interactive Map!" href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/map" target="_blank">Interactive Map</a> on Tamriel Foundry can help you find any Skyshards that you miss during your travels.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Optimizing Your Progression</h2>
<hr />


&nbsp;
<strong>Invest in inventory.</strong> Gold will be precious early on, low level enemies and quests will not reward you with exorbitant sums, so it is important to get the biggest return from investment when you spend coin at low level. Resist the temptation to buy yourself new gear, you will have plenty of opportunity to upgrade and improve your equipment as you adventure. The best early investment you can make as a low level player is to purchase backpack upgrades which will give your character more inventory space to work with as you adventure. More capacity to carry loot means fewer trips back to town, saving you time and travel costs. In each town there will be Bag Merchants who sell backpack upgrades; to find them mouse over stores and look for a bag icon. Each backpack upgrade increases your inventory space by 10 slots, but the cost of future upgrades increases.

[caption id="attachment_593896" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bag-space.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bag-space-450x253.jpg" alt="Inventory is the best available early investment." width="450" height="253" class="size-medium wp-image-593896" /></a> Inventory is the best available early investment.[/caption]<ul>
	<li>Backpack 1 - 400g   (40g/slot)</li>
	<li>Backpack 2 - 2000g  (200g/slot)</li>
	<li>Backpack 3 - 5900g  (590g/slot)</li>
	<li>Backpack 4 - 11000g (1100g/slot)</li>
	<li>Backpack 5 - 19200g (1920g/slot)</li>
</ul>

The second way you can improve your character's effective carrying capacity is by investing in riding bags (capcity) for your mount. Each capacity upgrade costs 250g and increases your inventory by 1 slot, up to a maximum of 60. This means that mount capacity upgrades are the most efficient method for increasing your inventory size after you have purchased the first two backpacks. My advice to new players is to prioritize these first two backpacks before anything else to get the biggest return from limited early-game gold.

&nbsp;
<strong>Stay on top of horse and research timers.</strong> In order to completely max out your character you will need to fully upgrade your Riding skill. The Riding skill has three components; Speed, Stamina, and Capacity. Each component has 60 upgrades, and you can only invest in one upgrade every 20 hours of real world time. This means it will take you 150 days to completely level your riding skill, and that is if you never miss an upgrade. Realistically for most players it will take almost an entire year to level this up. A better mount makes a big difference in game, being faster, able to sprint for longer, and able to carry more equipment into battle can make a big difference both in PvE and PvP. Remember, time is money. For PC players, there are a number of great addons that will remind you when you are able to upgrade your horse again. For console players consider keeping a timer outside of the game to remind yourself when to upgrade your mount. 

Similarly, for players who want to eventually be Tamrielic craft-masters, it takes a considerable amount of time to research new traits. Even with upgraded crafting skill and passives to allow you to learn new traits more effectively it will typically take almost a full year of research to learn how to craft every type of equipment. Make sure to monitor your crafting research, and have a method to remind yourself when you can begin researching new traits. Plan which traits you want to research next, and if possible keep some items in the bank that you know you need to research once you have the ability to do so.

&nbsp;
[caption id="attachment_594010" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/craft-lowbie-armor.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/craft-lowbie-armor-450x253.jpg" alt="Use crafting to create helm and shoulder pieces at low level." width="450" height="253" class="size-medium wp-image-594010" /></a> Use crafting to create helm and shoulder pieces at low level.[/caption]<strong>Diversify your wardrobe.</strong> While you are leveling, don't restrict yourself purely to the type of armor best fits your character build. Always use at least one piece of each armor type (Light, Medium, and Heavy). As you complete quests and earn new quest rewards, replace your items often. Particularly at low level, think carefully before you spend any gold on repairing your gear. Most items can just as easily be replaced as repaired and at far lower cost. Crafting is the easiest way to acquire certain pieces like helmets or shoulders at low level, since these types of armor typically don't appear naturally until after level 10.

As you reach the middle and upper character levels you will gravitate more towards your armor type of choice, especially once you can take advantage of the later passives in the armor skill that only work if you are using 5 or more pieces of that type. Splitting your armor 5/1/1 is a popular tactic even for endgame builds and especially when you are still leveling your skills. If you do purchase new equipment to use, consider buying pieces with the "Training" trait. While they offer no real combat benefit, training equipment will give you an experience multiplier towards the progression of their associated armor or weapon line.

&nbsp;
<strong>Prioritize skills over passives.</strong> Skill points will be relatively scarce early on. Make sure to invest wisely in abilities and morphs that will allow you to continue progressing your skills. Passives are a fantastic way to increase the power of your character, but they won't make a huge difference at low level. Unlocking new skills, and better morphs will make a huge difference. As you reach the mid-range in levels you will start to have more skill points at your disposal, this is a great time to start filling in the passive abilities that you bypassed earlier.

&nbsp;
<strong>Persuasion and Intimidation</strong> One exception to the above rule are the Persuade and Intimidate passives, from the Mages' Guild and Fighter's Guild skill lines respectively. These passives unlock additional dialogue options which frequently enable you to take advantage of easier methods for completing quests. It is worth investing early on (before level 15) in both Persuade and Intimidate. These two skill points will pay themselves back by speeding up your questing process by opening backdoors and shortcuts to complete objectives more easily.

&nbsp;
[caption id="attachment_594012" align="alignright" width="400"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hireling-rewards.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hireling-rewards-400x300.jpg" alt="You can use alts to your advantage to generate a constant stream of hireling rewards." width="400" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-594012" /></a> You can use alts to your advantage to generate a constant stream of hireling rewards.[/caption]<strong>Make great hireling decisions.</strong> Another exception to priotitizing skills over passives is to consider investing passive points into the "Hireling" nodes of the different tradeskill lines. This can be a costly proposition, as there are five different Hirelings your character can employ. Hirelings will send you an in-game mail every 24 hours containing a package of crafting materials for their related tradeskill. The great advantage of hirelings is that these packages not only provide a constant influx of crafting materials to help you level your trades more easily, but they can occasionally contain rare, epic, and even legendary upgrade components which are extremely valuable. 

A popular tactic to use involves leveraging your 7 additional character slots with "hireling bots" while you level your main character. After you have completed the tutorial, any new character you create can skip the tutorial and will automatically start with 3 skill points. By creating a fleet of hireling alts you can spend these 3 points right away in the first tier hireling for whichever tradeskills you prefer. If you take advantage of this method early on it is possible to stockpile epic and legendary upgrade materials that will save your character many thousands of gold in the long run. 

&nbsp;
<strong>Don't try to level as your final build.</strong> When you are choosing as you level how to invest attribute points, what gear to use, and which morph choices to pick, don't feel compelled to choose based on your envisioned final build. Certain choices will be easier while level, while others are more long-term options. The cost of respecializing is low enough that its worth making your life easier while leveling by choosing attributes, skills, and gear that is useful for leveling. You can always min-max your attributes later. Typically while leveling, a more even split between Health and your primary attribute of choice will be the most effective. 

&nbsp;
<strong>Quest with a partner, but only if they match your rhythm.</strong> The way that experience gain multipliers work in <em>ESO</em> means that you will gain more experience if you are adventuring in a group of two, not only will XP rewards be increased, but you will move significantly faster through quests and dungeons provided that your partner matches your adventuring rhythm. If you are leveling as a pair, you can also use Rings of Mara (either pre-order bonuses or purchased through the crown store) to earn additional experience while you are grouped. I would not, however, recommend trying to quest with a group larger than two. It will become difficult to keep everyone focused on the same task and you may lose time coordinatring your efforts. If you have a group of four that is leveling together, it would be prudent to work in teams of two and meet up as a full group to tackle challenges like world bosses and instanced dungeons.

[caption id="attachment_594004" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aspect-rune.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aspect-rune-450x270.jpg" alt="Valuable aspect runes can be easily identified by their orange glow." width="450" height="270" class="size-medium wp-image-594004" /></a> Valuable aspect runes can be easily identified by their orange glow.[/caption]<strong>The aspect of wealth.</strong> Even if you are not particularly interested in crafting on your main character it is strongly advisable to collect certain crafting materials while you level. The foremost of which is the Aspect runestone. These runestones glow a bright orange, making them easy to differentiate from other rune types. Unlike other runes (and most other crafting materials) the same types of aspect runes are used for every level of rune you craft. That means that looting an Aspect runestone at level 3 can potentially give you a crafting input that will still be required at VR14. Every aspect runestone has a small chance to yield a Kuta rune, which is a legendary quality runestone which is much coveted at max level to produce the most valuable item enchantments. Whenever you see an aspect runestone during your travels, never pass by without looting it.

&nbsp;
<strong>Weapon swapping isn't just for combat.</strong> Once you reach level 15 you will unlock the ability to "weapon swap" which switches between two weapon sets that you have equipped. By switching weapons you gain access to an additional 5 ability slots for that new weapon plus a different ultimate. For high-end PvE and PvE content you will find yourself weapon swapping a lot in combat to orchestrate deadly combos and maintain valuable buffs. While leveling, however, you will likely find that simply using your primary bar and not worrying about swapping sets is more effective. Even if you don't use weapon swapping much while you are leveling up, a great way to take advantage of this ability is for optimizing your experience gain from completing quests. You can keep five abilities that you would like to level, but don't necessarily want to have to use in combat on your alternate bar. Just swap to your alternate weapon before turning in a quest and get a significant XP boost to these skills and whatever weapon type you are using on that bar. It is a fantastic way to level a lot of the useful utility skills or weapon types that don't quite justify a spot on your main bar while you level up. 

&nbsp;

Food can be purchased from tavern owners in town, but you can also craft food for yourself using the countless provisioning supplies that you find from crates, barrels, and sacks throughout the world. Even low level food can be crafted fairly easily using common recipes and ingredients. The tomato soup recipe pictured to the right would increase the amount of Magicka my level 6 Nightblade can use in combat by 33%. Moreover, many players will sell low level recipes at very reasonable prices in zone chat, so keep an eye out for the knowledge required to make food that is most beneficial for your own character.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<strong>Never miss a good dungeon.</strong> Every dungeon in <em>ESO</em> has built in rewards that generate additional skill points for your character. Every "delve" (marked as a torch on the map) contains a skyshard. Every public dungeon (marked as a ruin entrance) contains a skyshard and a "group challenge" that automatically rewards a skill point if you complete it. Every instanced dungeon (marked as a tomb entrance) features a quest that rewards you with a skill point when you complete it for the first time. Even though you may not have quests directing you to explore these locations, be sure to do so. They will help a lot with providing you the points needed to advance your character quickly.

[caption id="attachment_594009" align="alignright" width="450"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/skill-book.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/skill-book-450x253.jpg" alt="Check bookshelves for valuable skill-increasing books." width="450" height="253" class="size-medium wp-image-594009" /></a> Check bookshelves for valuable skill-increasing books.[/caption]<strong>Book smarts equals street smarts.</strong> Read any bookshelves that you encounter during your travels. Many ruins, guild-halls, and other city buildings will have bookshelves within. Each time you read a bookshelf the game draws a random book for your character to read. Many of these books are "skill books" which will increase your character's effectiveness with a combat or crafting skill. These free skill ups can be very valuable and you should never pass by a bookshelf without checking its content. You do not have to actually read the book if you do not wish, although there are countless great lore books and other works that provide interesting color into the peoples and history of Tamriel.

&nbsp;
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Later On</h2>
<hr />

&nbsp;
<strong>Take a Skyshard tour of Cyrodiil.</strong> The PvP region of Cyrodiil contains 45 skyshards in total, 15 per section. Acquiring all of these skyshards would generate a whopping 15 skill points for your character to spend. You can enter Cyrodiil as early as level 10, but you should pick an opportune moment to try and collect all the skyshards. It is advisable to wait until off-peak gameplay hours and collect the Skyshards from a Cyrodiil campaign that is currently dominated by your own alliance. You may need to guest into a different campaign to find ideal conditions, so ask around with your friends and guildies first to see if the time is ripe for Cyrodiil plundering. Using a dominant campaign is important so you have a full network of owned keeps to enable you to travel more quickly. Also two of the skyshards per alliance lie behind the Elder Scroll gates which will only be open if you own the enemy keeps which control them. If no dominant campaign is available you therefore may be unable to obtain four of the Skyshards until later. If you use a map, a complete collection route may take 3-4 hours and will require you to collect shards from within dungeons that may be difficult for low level characters on their own. It's best to do this with a group of friends or guild members so everyone can benefit from all the extra skill points. 

&nbsp;
[caption id="attachment_594060" align="alignright" width="204"]<a href="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/prismatic-greatsword.jpg"><img src="http://tamrielfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/prismatic-greatsword-204x300.jpg" alt="Prismatic weapons may end up being valuable once VRs are removed." width="204" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-594060" /></a> Prismatic weapons may end up being valuable once VRs are removed.[/caption]<strong>Think about when to progress the main story, Mages' guild, and Fighter's guild.</strong> Think carefully about the best time for you to advance the Mages' Guild, Fighter's Guild, and main story quest lines. These quests have been altered so the difficulty of their content and the rewards they provide scale entirely to your characters level. More importantly, these quests frequently award rare jewelry pieces that are otherwise very difficult to obtain at lower levels. I would suggest completing the first wave of each of these quests as soon as you are able in order to fill your ring and amulet inventory slots on your character. Consider delaying later quests, however, to optimize on the rewards you can recieve or to give yourself a high XP reward quest to complete if you start to fall behind your other quest content.

<em>Minor spoilers ahead, if you are sensitive skip to the next section.</em> On a related note, I strongly recommend delaying completion of the final Fighter's Guild quest until you are into your Veteran ranks. This quest will reward you a "Prismatic weapon" which features a unique enchantment not obtainable on any other weapon. This enchantment makes the weapon particularly powerful against Undead and Daedric enemies which are extremely common in endgame PvE challenges. At the moment, this item will cap out at Veteran Rank 12, but given that ZeniMax Online plans to remove the Veteran Rank system in the future we expect this item will be scaled down to level 50 making it a potentially endgame-viable item for DPS characters. You will be able to complete this final quest as early as level 45, but I would strongly recommend saving it until you can get a higher ranked version of the item.

&nbsp;
<strong>Save epic and legendary upgrade materials.</strong> Resist the temptation to make yourself Epic (purple) gear before you reach Veteran levels. Moreover, avoid making Legendary (yellow) gear until you reach max level. It is simply not worth spending the materials on items you will ultimately replace. These upgrade materials can be very valuable so make sure to stockpile any you collect so you will be able to outfit your character competitively once you reach VR14.

&nbsp;
<strong>Alchemy is for everyone.</strong> The third passive node in the Alchemy skill tree makes the beneficial effects of potions last longer. To be fully optimized for endgame PvE content you will want to reach rank 3/3 of Medicinal Use which will require you to invest in the Alchemy skill at some stage. Forewarned is forearmed, and you may want to simply focus on leveling Alchemy while you level your character rather than going back and trying to do it later.
