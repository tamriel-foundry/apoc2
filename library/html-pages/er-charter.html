<header><h4 id="aboutus">About Us <a class="scroll-top" href="#top">Top</a></h4></header>
<p>Entropy Rising is a competitive progression guild representing the Aldmeri Dominion in <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and is the official in-game arm of Tamriel Foundry on the North America PC megaserver. We strive for excellence in both PvE and PvP challenges while fostering an atmosphere of friendship, camaraderie, and combined purpose within our guild community. We are not a large guild; above all else we are a group of friends, like-minded gamers, and MMO enthusiasts. Collectively, we endeavor to act as ambassadors within the <em>ESO</em> community while conquering the game’s many challenges.  Our core membership has been together through several MMOs; and we maintain lofty recruiting standards which allow us to preserve the spirit of our tight-knit community.</p>

<p>Our members each strive for individual excellence so that our collective efforts are successful. We expect members of Entropy Rising to uphold our core tenets and seek out opportunities to set a positive example throughout the <em>ESO</em> community. These responsibilities are rewarded through veteran leadership, fair guild rules, respect and prestige within the <em>ESO</em> community, and a laid-back atmosphere of shared enthusiasm for gaming. Despite our individually extensive MMO histories, Entropy Rising is not a multi-game community. Our singular purpose is <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and we are seeking exceptional members who share that focus.</p>

<header><h4 id="tenets">Our Tenets <a class="scroll-top" href="#top">Top</a></h4></header>
<p>The guild vision of Entropy Rising is protected by a simple set of rules and responsibilities to which we hold our members accountable. These core philosophies describe the expected behavior of all ER guild members, and emphasize the cornerstone principles of the guild.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h2>Individual Excellence</h2>
		<p><em>Be prepared, knowledgable, and capable.</em> Each Entropy Rising member should easily adapt to a variety of in-game scenarios. Our members should exemplify proficient gameplay; mastering not only of their preferred role, but posessing the versatility to fill multiple positions within a group.</p>
		<p><em>Optimize your character.</em> It is the responsibility of every member to perfect his or her gear and build, quickly adapting to new patch cycles and meta-trends.</p>
		<p><em>Be reliable.</em> Our members are required maintain a high level of attendance to scheduled guild events, arriving prepared with consumables, supplies, and a variety of equipment sets.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h2>Social Involvement</h2>
		<p><em>Be socially active.</em> Entropy Rising places a critical value on sustaining a tight-knit community; social engagement is of paramount importance. We expect all our members to actively participate in TeamSpeak, regardless of the game they are playing. Voice chat is crucial both for communication and because we believe that friendship is the backbone of a successful guild.</p>
		<p><em>Play with guildies.</em> We want our members to actively seek opportunities for multi-player gaming, even if it is not <em>ESO</em> related. Play games, group up, and get involved with other guild members whenever possible.</p>
	</li>	

	<li>
		<h2>Community Contribution</h2>
		<p><em>Contribute to Tamriel Foundry.</em> The central vision of Tamriel Foundry is to create a valuable resource for theorycrafting, strategies, mechanics discussions, and guides for the <em>ESO</em> community. We expect our members to further these goals by sharing their insights for optimizing gameplay experience with the website community. We hope Entropy Rising guild members will share in a sense of collective ownership of Tamriel Foundry and be proud of our success both in-game and on the website. Every active member of Entropy Rising is expected to be a participant on the website forums with further responsibilities required of core raiders and officers.</p>
		<p><em>Prioritize Testing and Feedback.</em> We expect active members of Entropy Rising to assist with testing the release of future content on the Public Test Server (PTS). Some guild events will be schedule on the PTS and ER members should treat PTS events with a high degree of seriousness so we can continue our track record of providing exceptional feedback to ZeniMax developers as they work to improve the game.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Positive Attitude</h2>
		<p><em>Act with maturity.</em> We thrive on competition, but within Entropy Rising we maintain an atmosphere of mutual respect. As an extension of Tamriel Foundry, we are ambassadors within the <em>ESO</em> community. Malicious trolling, baiting, trash talking, or flaming are not permitted in-game or on any public forum. We generally require applicants to be 18 years or older in order to be eligible for membership.</p>
		<p><em>Those without thick skin need not apply.</em> We achieve a delicate balance between a casual fun-loving atmosphere and determination for in-game success. Each member of Entropy Rising is pushed to become a better player by his or her peers. We love jokes, banter, and general shenanigans; often at each other’s expense. We are not a family oriented guild, and we are not responsible for your hurt feelings.</p>
		<p><em>Abide by the decisions of guild leadership.</em> Our leaders and officers are veteran MMO gamers, and we are familiar with the issues that accompany leading a high-powered guild. We understand the need to manage people, not just roster slots. We are open to feedback from our members, but there is a time and place for such discussions. Whining, arguing, or causing a scene in the middle of a scheduled guild event is not tolerated.</p>
		<p><em>Have fun.</em> We are a serious guild, but don’t forget that we play Elder Scrolls Online because we love MMOs, and we love the Elder Scrolls. If you’re not having fun, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<header><h4 id="structure">Guild Structure <a class="scroll-top" href="#top">Top</a></h4></header>
<p>Our guild is organized using the minimum number of separate ranks functionally necessary to reward increased levels of player dedication. We don’t believe in an endless ladder of ranks which makes newer members feel unreasonably distant from positions of power. Our guild is designed to accommodate between 25 and 30 active members. Once these spots are filled recruitment will be closed until any replacements are needed.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h2>Initiate</h2>
		<p>New guild members undergo trial period lasting between two and four weeks during which their performance, interaction with guild members, and participation within the community are evaluated. This trial ensures that players that join ER on a permanent basis are great fit for the guild both socially and from a gameplay perspective.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Member</h2>
		<p>Entropy Rising members form the foundation of the guild, giving us a strong community platform. Members are expected to maintain reliable attendance of guild events, assist fellow guild-members to achieve their in-game goals, and participate in guild PvP initiatives.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Core Member</h2>
		<p>The core membership of Entropy Rising represents the best our guild has to offer. Core members comprise the backbone of our raid team in Trials or in PvP. Core members have the increased expectation that they will actively contribute to their own class areas of Tamriel Foundry by submitting class and build guides, tips, and suggestions.<p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Officer</h2>
		<p>Two guild officers assist with executive decision making, guild coordination, recruitment, and leading guild events. In conjunction with the Guildmaster, Entropy Rising officers provide the guild with leadership, driving the guild to grow and succeed both inside and out of <em>ESO</em>.
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Guildmaster</h2>
		<p>As the founder of Entropy Rising and Tamriel Foundry, I am a longtime veteran of the MMO genre with extensive raiding, PvP, and guild leadership experience. The collaboration and long-term vision of myself and the guild officers have worked to shape Entropy Rising into a premiere <em>ESO</em> guild that has become a fixture of the game's community.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h2>Inactive/Social</h2>
		<p>One of the best aspects of the Entropy Rising community is that we are a group of close friends who have more in common than simply forming the same in-game groups. Entropy Rising prides itself on being a great community of gamers and we recognize that <em>ESO</em> isn't the perfect MMO for everyone. We invite and encourage any inactive members to remain involved with the guild in TeamSpeak and in any alternative games that we play together. A guild member is considered Inactive/Social if they do not maintain an active <em>ESO</em> subscription or fail to meet the regular attendance requirements of the Member rank. The only requirements facing inactive members are to remain in periodic social contact with the guild in order to not be removed from the roster.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<header><h4 id="loot">Events and Attendance Policy <a class="scroll-top" href="#top">Top</a></h4></header>
<p>We conduct scheduled PvE or PvP events 3 nights a week, Monday through Wednesday from 9pm-12am EST. Core Members are expected to maintain over 66% attendance of scheduled guild events. Raid signups are conducted in advance through a calendar on the guild website. Officers should be notified of expected absences at least 24 hours in advance so we have time to ensure sufficient attendance of all our events. Entropy Rising maintains a shared loot bank in which we store rare and valuable crafting materials and unbound loot. This loot is distributed using a meritocracy that considers both standing within the guild as well as base need. This policy helps to guarantee that our core members are always equipped competitively and have the tools required for the guild to succeed.</p>

<header><h4 id="application">Application Process <a class="scroll-top" href="#top">Top</a></h4></header>
<p>In order to meet our lofty ambitions as a guild we maintain high expectations of potential guild applicants.

We want members with excellent communication skills and colorful personalities. If you think you have what it takes to be a part of Entropy Rising, we would like to encourage you to visit our application page. We carefully review all applications, and potential recruits are carefully considered to guarantee they exemplify the attributes described above. We respond to all applicants via the email address associated with your Tamriel Foundry user account.
